# Introduction #

This part of the book is for those who don’t have any basic knowledge of Docker. In case you do, don’t be shy and jump to the next part. However, even if you do know Docker, we are presenting explanations on several available resources and how they work. Even if you are a regular Docker user, reading this part of the book at some point of your life can be important in order to know more about what happens at every executed command.
