# Preface

In software development it is usual to create good practices for standards. Especially for web applications, certain concepts and practices such as DevOps, cloud infrastructure, Phoenix, immutable and 12 factor apps are widely accepted theories that help on systems productivity and maintenance. While these concepts are not new, many are the tools and systems that can help to implement them. But Docker is one of the first and most commented tools and platforms that combine many of these concepts in a cohesive and simple way. As any tool, Docker is an investment that provides the best return when you understand its purpose and how to use it properly.

There are several presentations, papers and documents about Docker. However, there was the opportunity of a book connecting the theory to the practice of the tool, in which the reader could understand the motivations of Docker and also how to organize the application in order to get the best from the tool.

I am very pleased that Rafael wrote this book that I believe it’s an important contribution to our field.

Rafael is extremely engaged in Docker and Devops communities in Brazil, and understands what people seek in terms of knowledge regarding this subject. In this book you will be able to understand the basics on Docker with a simple language and many practical examples.

I hope this publication turns into one more step to boost your journey. I wish you success and all the best.

Best regards,
